I have started editing PDF solutions for the exercises in the book [Quantum Field Theory and the Standard Model](https://www.cambridge.org/highereducation/books/quantum-field-theory-and-the-standard-model/A4CD66B998F2C696DCC75B984A7D5799#overview) by *Matthew D. Schwartz*.


You can view the Schwartz solution [here](assets/pdf/Schwartz_solution.pdf).


Feel free to send me any comments if you find a mistake or have suggestions for improvements.
